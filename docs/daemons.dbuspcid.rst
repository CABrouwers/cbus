dbuspcid
========

dbuspcid is a daemon that emulates a PC Interface, allowing you to use it to
connect to cdbusd.

This allows you to use applications on other computers to communicate with a
virtual PCI, which in turn passes events to cdbusd.  It also allows you to use
applications that do not support the cdbusd API directly.
