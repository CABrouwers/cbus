Lighting Application
====================

The lighting application is the most commonly used application on the C-Bus network.

It is used for turning lights on and off, and setting lights to a particular brightness.

Sometimes the lighting application is used to control other, non-lighting loads, such as exhaust fans.

Please refer to this document in conjunction with the `Lighting Application Guide`_ published by Clipsal.
