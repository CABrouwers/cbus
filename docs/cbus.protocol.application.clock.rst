Clock and Timekeeping Application
=================================

The Clock and Timekeeping Application is used to provide access to date and time information to CBus units.

This is used for example in conjunction with programmable units that act differently depending on the time or date, and with touchscreen units that may display the time on their screens.

Please refer to this document in conjunction with the `Clock and Timekeeping Application Guide`_ published by Clipsal.
