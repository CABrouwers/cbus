Temperature Broadcast Application
=================================

The Temperature Broadcast application is used to notify units on the C-Bus network of changes in temperature.  It is used to allow temperature control systems to react to changes in environmental conditions.

This has been replaced by the Measurement application (not get implemented by ``libcbus``).

Please refer to this document in conjunction with the `Temperature Broadcast Application Guide`_ published by Clipsal.
