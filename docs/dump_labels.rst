dump_labels utility
===================

dump_labels parses a Toolkit backup file (CBZ) and prints out group and unit
address labels into a JSON file.

It will remove all unneeded programming markup from the CBZ, and leave a
skeleton of information which can be used in conjunction with the library and
other applications.
