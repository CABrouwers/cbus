cdbusd
======

cdbusd is a daemon that is used to allow multiple applications on the same
computer to share use of a PC Interface.

The daemon also provides clock services to the C-Bus network.

It is recommended when building C-Bus applications that you use the D-Bus interface to the network.

For more information on the D-Bus client interface, please see :ref:`dbus-client`.
